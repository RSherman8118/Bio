	<p>I'm passionate about art, design and bringing both worlds together.<br/><br/>
I'm currently working as the Marketing Designer in the marketing and communications office at The New School where I'm primarily responsible for concepting and designing most of their advertising campaigns.<br/><br/>
My artwork is inspired by the New York Cityâ€™s constant evolution, collective memory, imaginary picture and ultimate essence. My paintings feature architectural structures and transcendental environments of an urban landscape intoxicated by color and illumination. The quixotic reconstruction of the city paints a visual soundtrack for the intangible experience of its changing space.<br/><br/>
